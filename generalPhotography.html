    <p>I've taken lots of photos over the years that I have carried a smartphone daily. A few of these here were also taken using my girlfriend's DSLR. As I get more into photography, I'd like to start some projects that focus on one subject, but here I wanted to exhibit a range of my work. Open any of the images in a new tab to see it full wack.</p>

                    <div class="caption">My mum loves a good holiday deal, and this landed on us going to Tenerife in two consectutive years. This was photo was taken on the second time we went, and is of a beach club (just a little) nicer than the place that we were staying. It was one of the first photos I took and looked back on and was chuffed with how it looked. Taken on my old Samsung Galaxy s10.</div>

                    <div class="caption">I've often found Hertfordshire an uninspiring place to grow up, but I've taken a lot for granted. There is a lot of history there and it also places me close enough to London to have the priveledge of exploring there. This photo was taken at the De Havilland Museum which sits just outside of St Albans. On this particular day they had a Porsche meet too, and I thought the pair looked quite menacing. Taken on my girlfriend's Nikon D3300.</div>

                    <div class="caption">My girlfriend and I had gone to Deep Sea World in North Queensferry, and when we came out the Forth Bridge was looking very proud in the sun. It's a very iconic scottish monument and its hard to not take a good photo of it. Taken on my iPhone 13 Pro.</div>

                    <div class="caption">I've spent the last four years studying in Edinburgh, and this was taken in my second year at my friend's flat. Their place always served as the central meeting point and I have very fond memories being there. Taken on my iPhone 13 Pro.</div>

                    <div class="caption">Univeristy keeps me very busy in Edinburgh, and often my girlfriend and I forget that we don't have to stay in the city 24/7. This photo was taken on a day drip to St. Andrew's and encapsultes what the Americans would call the 'quaintness' of the place. Taken on my iPhone 13 Pro.</div>

                    <div class="caption">My girlfriend and I visited Deep Sea World in North Queensferry, which apparently boasts the largest underwater tunnel in Europe (who would have known). When I think of shark this is the image I think of, so to get this on camera is very pleasing. Taken on my iPhone 13 Pro.</div>

                    <div class="caption">Spotted this tidal pool by the castle in St. Andrews and thought it was very clever. I like designs that harness nature and they really remind me of what the glory days of british holidaying would have been like. Supposedly coming to be in 1903, its nice to see some brave folk still try it out (I didn't bring my swimming gear otherwise I would have (trust me)). Taken on my iPhone 13 Pro.</div>

                    <div class="caption">Apart from the booming popularity of running and thus the foot traffic, Edinburgh is a terrific place to get your kilometers in. One of my favourite routes takes me to Portobello beach and back, via the bottom of Arthurs Seat. The sunset was mega on this day and made for a very pleasing setting. Taken on my iPhone 13 Pro.</div>
