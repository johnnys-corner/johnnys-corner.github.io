    <p>Americana excites me even if modern day America does not. We don't often see much of it over in the UK, but here is a collection of photos of things that I think break the mould.</p>

                    <div class="caption">My mum and her partner have always been on the rocking scene which began in the UK in the 80's, in fact it is where they first met. He has and still is a big hot rod guy, and despite not having one anymore, still enjoys going to the events. This photo was taken at a garage of a friend of his, Billy, who runs the auto shop in Surrey. I particularly liked this '55 Chevy which was hiding in the shadows of shop during the meet. Taken on my girlfriend's Nikon D3300.</div>

                    <div class="caption">Taken at the same car meet as the photo of the 55 Chevy, at Billy's garage in Surrey. I find it funny how these californian cars have ended up on an industrial estate in the south of England, but nonetheless they look great. Taken on my girlfriend's Nikon D3300.</div>

                    <div class="caption">Believe it or not this photo was taken in Edinburgh. I've lived fairly close to this building for many years and have always admired it's art deco styling, and liked how it very much doesn't fit in with the typical Edinburgh aesthetic. I'd like to catch it on a sunset one day. Taken on my iPhone 13 Pro.</div>
