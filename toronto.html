    <p>In the summer of 2024, I spent 3 months in the greater Toronto area, specifically Mississauga. I found the sheer size of North America intimidating but I learned a lot being in a new environment like this. I took several photos that I really like and look back on fondly. Here they are.</p>

I thought it was pretty wicked and also something that we just wouldn't see over in the UK. Looking at this does remind me how hot it was all summer though (and also wet, the largest single day of rainfall in Toronto history occured when I was there). Taken on my iPhone 13 Pro.</div>

I really enjoy walking, and although the GTA is not particularly walkable, I was stubborn and still walked to the lab everyday. However, what this meant is that I got to see things along the way, like these funky Zig-Zag buildings in Downtown mMississauga. Taken on my iPhone 13 Pro.</div>
